## Introduction

The `ML-Mini-Projects` repository includes a collection of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various machine learning algorithms and techniques. Each notebook corresponds to a different machine learning project covered in the Udemy course "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp."

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

1. **Linear Regression**
    - `ML_Ecommerce_company.ipynb`: A project demonstrating linear regression on e-commerce data.
    
2. **Logistic Regression**
    - `ML-Titanic.ipynb`: A project utilizing logistic regression to predict Titanic survival rates.
    
3. **K Nearest Neighbors**
    - `KNN.ipynb`: A project showcasing the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
    
4. **Decision Trees and Random Forests**
    - `DT_RF_Loans_Project.ipynb`: A project applying decision trees and random forests to a loans dataset.
    
5. **Support Vector Machines**
    - `SVM_Iris_project.ipynb`: A project using support vector machines on the Iris dataset.
    
6. **K Means**
    - `02-K Means Clustering Project.ipynb`: A project demonstrating K Means clustering.

## Technologies

- **Python**: The primary language used for implementing the machine learning algorithms.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive environment for running the code and visualizing the results.
- **Various Python Libraries**: Including but not limited to `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

## Installation

To run the notebooks, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ML-Mini-Projects.git
    cd ML-Mini-Projects
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -U scikit-learn

    or

    conda install scikit-learn
    ```

## Usage

Open the desired Jupyter notebook to explore the corresponding machine learning project. You can launch Jupyter Notebook from the command line:

```bash
jupyter notebook
